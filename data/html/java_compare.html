                    <p> <b>[ memory management ]:&nbsp;</b> java has automatic memory management (garbage collection), while C++ requires manual memory management.</p> 
                    <p> <b>[ plathform independence ]:&nbsp;</b> java is pathform-independent due to the <a href='hello.html#jvm'>JVM</a>, while C++ code is compiled for a specific plathform. </p>
                    <p> <b>[ object-oriented ]:&nbsp;</b> both are object-oriented, but java enforces it strictly, wherecase C++ provides more flexibility. </p>
                    <p> <b>[ safety ]:&nbsp;</b> java is generally considered safer due to its memory management and strong typing. </p>

                    <h3> Java VS Python </h3>
                    <p> <b>[ type system ]:&nbsp;</b> java has a static type system, while python is dynamically typed. </p>
                    <p> <b>[ performance ]:&nbsp;</b> java is generally faster than Python for computintensive tasks. </p>
                    <p> <b>[ ecosystem ]:&nbsp;</b> python is known for its extensive libraries and ease of use, while java widely used in enterprise applications. </p>
                    <p> <b>[ syntax ]:&nbsp;</b> python's syntax is often considered more concise and readable. </p>

                    <p> <b>[ use case ]:&nbsp;</b> java is often used for back-end server application and adroid mobile app developement, while javascript is primarlly used for web. </p>
                    <p> <b>[ type system ]:&nbsp;</b> java is statically typed, whereas JavaScript is dynamically typed. </p>
                    <p> <b>[ browser execution ]:&nbsp;</b> javaScript uns in web brosers, whereas java appplets in web brosers are less common today. </p>

                    <p> <b>[ ecosystem ]:&nbsp;</b> c# is closely tied to the microsoft ecosystem, while java has broder usage. </p>
                    <p> <b>[ syntax ]:&nbsp;</b> both have similarities due to their common ancestry, but they have distinct features and libraries. </p>
