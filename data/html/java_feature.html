                    <h3> platform independence </h3>
                    <p> jav is "write once, run anywhere". it's designed to be plathform-independent, thanks to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Code written in java can be executed on any device or operating system with a compatible JVM. </p>                    
                </mark>

                    <h3> object-oriented </h3>
                    <p> java is a purely object-oriented programming language, which promotes modularity, reusability and maintainability of code. </p>        
                
                </mark>
            </li>
            <li>

                    <h3> strongly typed </h3>
                    <p> java enforces strong data typing, which helps catch type-related errors at compile time, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors. </p>
                </mark>
            </li>
            <li>
                <mark>
                    <h3> automatic memory management </h3>
                    <p> java managers memory automatically through its built-in garbage collection, which dealloates memory from objects that are no longer in use, helping prevent memory leaks. </p>
                </mark>
            </li>
            <li>
                <mark>
                    <h3> security </h3>
                    <p> java has built-in security features, including a secuirty manager and a robust set of APIs FOR encryption, authentication, and access control. </p>
                </mark>
            </li>
            <li>

                    <h3> mutlithreading </h3>
                    <p> java provides built-in in support for multithreading, making it easier to develop applications that can perform multiple tasks concurrently. </p>
                </mark>
            </li>
            <li>
                <mark>
                    <h3> rich standard library </h3>
                    <p> java incudes a vast standard library that provides classes and methods for a wide range of functions, simplifying developement and reducing the need for third-party libraries. </p>
                </mark>
            </li>
            <li>
                <mark>
                    <h3> exception handling </h3>
                    <p> java has a robust exception-handling mechanism, allowing developers to handle and recover from errors in a structred manner. </p>
                </mark>
            </li>
            <li>

                    <h3> simple and familier syntax </h3>
                    <p> java is syntax is similar to C & C++, making it easier for developers with a background in these languages to learn java. </p> 
                </mark>
            </li>
            <li>

                    <h3> hight performance </h3>
                    <p> while java is often associated with being interpreted and slower than lower-level languages, it offers high performance throught jsut-in-time (JIT) compilation. </p>
                </mark>
            </li>
